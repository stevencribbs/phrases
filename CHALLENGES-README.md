# Challenges

The idea behind challenges is to provide a playground for working with the technologyies at various stages of the project.  By completing stages of the project (or adding additional functionality), the coder has an opportunity to learn and play with the concepts connected with different parts of the tech stack. 

The challenges folder contains copies of the phrases project at different stages of development.  Each challenge folder provides an opportunity to add additional code and functionality. The completed functionality from the original project for that challenge can be seen in the following challenge (i.e. the completed code for challenge 1 can be viewed in the source code for challenge 2 - or in within the main project).

Information and instructions for each challenge can be found in the CHALLENGE-README.md located in each challenge directory.
