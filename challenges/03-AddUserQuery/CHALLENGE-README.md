# Challenge 3

The goal of this challenge is to extend familiarity with creating GraphQL queries by adding a user query using TypeGraphQL.

Task: Create a query that returns a list of users.  The return data should include:
- userKey
- firstName
- lastName
- email

Steps
- Create an output type for Users, similar to the Phrase type.
- Create a new Resolver for Users with a query for returning a list of users.

Notes
- Password data should never be returned or displayed.
- Database functions have been created for retrieving a single user and a list of users.
- Query functionality should be demonstratable within the Apollo Sandbox.
