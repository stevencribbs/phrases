# Challenge 1

The goal of this challenge is to gain familiarity with GraphQL queries and adding a new query using TypeGraphQL.

Task: The `PhraseQueries.ts` file contains one query for requesting phrases.  Add at least one more query that will request phrases by the `phraseType` property.  The query should receive parameters for `userKey` and `phraseType`; and, then return an array of phrases based on that phraseType.

Notes
- Database function have been created in the `DBService.ts` file for retrieving phrases.
- Query functionality should be demonstratable within the Apollo Sandbox.
